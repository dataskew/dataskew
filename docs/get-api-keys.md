## FAQs on API keys

#### Where can I see all my API keys?
Go to the [DataSkew dev portal](https://dataskew.portal.azure-api.net), sign in with your dev account and access your profile information. All your API keys and subscription details will be listed there.

#### How many API keys can I get per pricing tier subscription?
Currently we only issue 1 API key per pricing tier subscription.

#### Are there any usage quotas?
Yes, usage quota restrictions apply. The specifics depend on the [pricing tier you're subscribed to](./#pricing).

#### Is rate limiting enforced?
Yes, to prevent DoS incidents, the APIs are rate limited. The specifics depend on the [pricing tier you're subscribed to](./#pricing).  

#### Can I share my API key with others?
Technically you can, but it is not a good idea. Usage & metrics are tracked at API key level. Any subsequent quotas/restrictions will also apply at API key level. So best not to share your API keys with anyone else.

#### Do you have any code samples?
Yes, please check [this page](./code-samples) out for details.
